This model uses data from three of the largest clinical trials on medication assisted opioid treatment (CTN-0027, CTN-0030, CTN-0051). This software was developed at the University of Miami Department of Public Health Sciences in collaboration with Columbia University’s Department of Psychiatry. The published probabilities are for research purposes only. Estimates are not substitute for medical opinions by qualified physicians regarding opioid use disorder treatment. Results from this app should only be used in conjunction with all other clinical information in each case.
